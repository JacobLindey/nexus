## Description

### Appearance

Tace is tall and gaunt with a shock of short, gray hair and a well trimmed beard. Most often, he can be found in threadbare regal court attire that once bore the deep azure hue associated with the Barony of Bedegar.

### Personality

Tace is usually grumpy, a result of the immense stress he has placed upon himself. He is intollerant of small talk and the use of airy but vapid language that his betters leverage to impress their guests.

Most of his associates find him unpleasant -- he frequently ignores them and neglects his duties in favor of more interesting matters. In general, Tace does not care what others think and only measures his and other's worth on their accomplishments. He may not remember your name but he will remember what you did for him and be thankful.
