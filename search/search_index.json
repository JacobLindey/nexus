For a timeline of history as it is now known, with dates, see [[Timeline]]. Contents Before the creation of Empyrean Arrival of the Alkyri First Aetheric War The Gift The Wellspring Before the creation of Empyrean \u00b6 Throughout the Timescape, a common creation myth sits at the root of most systems of belief -- from a state of disorder, unknowable timelessness, and an endless expanse of darkness, [[Empyr]] wrought a place and a time from [[Beyond]] using the [[Dawnshards]]. The super-manifold [[Emyrean]] formed in this new place and was set tumbling through this time. This is where the similarities end. Some believe Empyr was (or is still) a god of immense power, the Prime Being. Others believe it to be an initiating force, devoid of thought or feeling, unaware of its creation. Little is known of the Dawnshards -- what they were, if they still exist, how many there are -- all questions that no living in the Many Worlds today know with certainty. Arrival of the Alkyri \u00b6 In the earliest days of Empyrean, the [[Alkyri]] emerged as the first beings to inhabit it. Among them three great peoples gathered: the ardent [[Vaeprah]], the clever [[Nephalim]], and the inquisitive [[Drakken]]. Together, the Alkyri forged a life from the land around them and, though they could not behold Its glory directly, they worshiped Empyr as thanks for their paradise. First Aetheric War \u00b6 Main article: [[First Aetheric War]] After a century of peace upon Empyrean, the [[Aether Kin]] appeared from Beyond. These projections of timeless beings from outside space devastated creation, consuming all in their path. From the very essense of Empyr itself, the [[Guardians]] rose against the Aether Kin and rallied the Alkyri to drive the invaders from their home. The Gift \u00b6 In the wake of this First Conflict, the Guardians settled and the Alkyri began to reforge their lives. Among the ashes of war they discovered a gift -- immense energy that, when wielded by a careful hand, could mold the very fabric of reality to their will. They called it [[Dweomer]]. The Wellspring \u00b6 Main article: [[Wellspring]] The Wellspring is the first major period of the Timescape. During this time, the Alkyri used the Gift to sculpt the lands of Empyrean to better suit their liking and bore children to inhabit their paradise.
